This project focuses on enhancing fault classification in induction motors using advanced machine-learning techniques. It combines the Generalized Hurst Exponent and R/S analysis for feature extraction and integrates a Random Forest classifier with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for improved fault detection.

**Background**
Induction motors are critical in various industries, and their efficient operation is crucial. Faults in these motors can lead to significant operational disruptions and financial losses, necessitating reliable fault detection methods.

**Objectives**
To improve the accuracy of fault classification in induction motors.
To develop a hybrid model combining the strengths of Random Forest classifiers and RNNs.
To assess the model's performance against conventional machine learning algorithms.

**Methodology**
Feature Extraction: Utilizing the Generalized Hurst Exponent and R/S analysis to analyze motor current signatures.
Model Development: Creating a hybrid model that combines a Random Forest classifier with an RNN for enhanced classification performance.

**Results**
The project's outcomes indicate substantial improvements in fault diagnosis, potentially benefiting various industrial applications. The Random Forest model, in particular, showed promising results.The RNN model integrated with the Dynamic Bayesian Network shows a result of 98% accuracy without fine-tuning, and the MLP Model (after a bit of fine-tuning) shows a result of 98.4%. There is still a lot of scope for fine-tuning them as the good results account for better feature extraction technique using Hurst Exponents.

**Conclusion and Future Directions**
The study opens new avenues for integrating neural networks with ensemble learning in industrial settings. Future work may explore further refinements and broader applications of this model.
